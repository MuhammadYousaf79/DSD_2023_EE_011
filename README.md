# Digital_System_Design_Lab

This repository contains lab assignments for the Digital System Design (DSD) course at **University of Engineering and Technology (UET)**, for Session 2023 Section A.

## Lab Assignments

- **Lab_no_1**: [Patched a NOT gate on Breadboard to find the propagation Delay]  
- **Lab_no_2**: [RTL and Texrbench code to know QuestaSim]
- **Lab_no_3**: [RTL code to know Vivado]
- **Lab_no_4**: [RTL and Testbench for Full Adder ]  
- **Lab_no_5**: [Combinational Circuit for Seven Segemnt Display]  
- **Lab_no_7**: [Sequentail Circuit for Seven Segemnt Display]  

## Technologies Used

- **SystemVerilog**: For Design And Testbench
- **QuestaSim**: For Simulation
- **Nexys A7** : For Hardware testing
- **Vivado**: For Designing Circuits for FPGA

## Getting Started

To run the SystemVerilog files:

1. Ensure you have **QuestaSim** or **Vivado** installed.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadYousaf79/DSD_2023_EE_011.git
3. Navigate to the desired lab directory:
   ```bash
